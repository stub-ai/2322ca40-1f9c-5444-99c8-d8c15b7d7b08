In the 'New Contact' screen, there is a card named 'brand'. Inside this card, there is a gallery containing checkboxes. I want to link these checkboxes to 6 different 'Yes/No' data cards. The behavior should be: if a checkbox is checked, the corresponding DataCardValue should be set to true. If a checkbox is unchecked, the DataCardValue should be set to false. Additionally, these DataCardValues are not visible, so I can't visually verify if they are set correctly until I open SharePoint. How can I resolve this issue?","md5":"96fa740ca72ed1758a2c08c4a9fe8a9e"}]}
